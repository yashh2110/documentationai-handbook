## Key Features

Explore core functionalities that make Paperguide powerful for teams. You integrate with tools like GitHub for syncing code docs and use search for quick access.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Spaces" icon="folder">
    Spaces act as containers for related documentation. You customize permissions per space to control access.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example API call to create a space
    const createSpace = async (name) => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/spaces', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ name }),
      });
      return response.json();
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pages" icon="file-text">
    Pages support MDX for interactive content. You embed diagrams and code snippets directly.
    
    <Expandable title="Advanced Page Options">
      Enable versioning and comments on pages for better collaboration.
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Fetch documentation pages
  const getPages = async (spaceId) => {
    const pages = await fetch(`/api/spaces/${spaceId}/pages`);
    return pages.json();
  };
  ```
  ```python
  # Fetch documentation pages
  import requests
  response = requests.get(f'/api/spaces/{space_id}/pages')
  pages = response.json()
  ```
</CodeGroup>
